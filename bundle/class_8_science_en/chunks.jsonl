Whenever a chemical change occurs, we can say that a **chemical reaction** has taken place. Observations that help to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place include change in state, change in colour, evolution of a gas, or change in temperature. There is a large variety of chemical reactions taking place around us. This chapter explores the various types of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation."}
