  "summary": "This chapter introduces chemical reactions, their characteristics, and their symbolic representation through chemical equations. It details the process of balancing chemical equations based on the law of conservation of mass. The various types of chemical reactions—combination, decomposition, displacement, double displacement (including precipitation), and oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions—are explained with examples. Finally, the chapter covers the everyday effects of oxidation, namely corrosion and rancidity.",

Whenever a chemical change occurs, we can say that a **chemical reaction** has taken place. Observations that help to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place include change in state, change in colour, evolution of a gas, or change in temperature. There is a large variety of chemical reactions taking place around us. This chapter explores the various types of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation.",

Nitrogen displaces the oxygen (air) inside the package, slowing down the oxidation of the fats and oils, which otherwise would change the smell and taste of the food."

            "answer": "A balanced chemical equation is one where the number of atoms of each element is equal on both the reactant side (LHS) and the product side (RHS) of the equation. Chemical equations should be balanced to satisfy the Law of Conservation of Mass, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Therefore, the total mass and the number of atoms of each element must remain the same before and after the reaction."

Examples include: **Burning of natural gas** ($CH_{4}(g)+2O_{2}(g)\\rightarrow CO_{2}(g)+2H_{2}O(g)$) and the **reaction of quick lime with water** ($CaO(s)+H_{2}O(l)\\rightarrow Ca(OH)_{2}(aq)+Heat$). Endothermic reactions are those in which energy is absorbed. Examples include: **Decomposition of Calcium carbonate** by heat ($CaCO_{3}(s)\\rightarrow CaO(s)+CO_{2}(g)$) and the **decomposition of Silver chloride** by light ($2AgCl(s)\\rightarrow 2Ag(s)+Cl_{2}(g)$)."

The glucose ($C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$), obtained from the digestion of food, combines with oxygen ($O_2$) in the body's cells to produce carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and water ($H_2O$), along with a significant amount of **energy**.

In contrast, a **decomposition reaction** involves a single reactant breaking down to give two or more simpler products. \n\n**Combination Equation (Example)**: $CaO(s)+H_{2}O(l)\\rightarrow Ca(OH)_{2}(aq)$\n\n**Decomposition Equation (Example)**: $CaCO_{3}(s)\\xrightarrow{Heat} CaO(s)+CO_{2}(g)$"

It involves a more reactive element replacing a less reactive one. \n\n**Example (Displacement)**: $Fe(s) + CuSO_{4}(aq) \\rightarrow FeSO_{4}(aq) + Cu(s)$ \n\nIn a **double displacement reaction**, there is an exchange of ions between the two reactant compounds. \n\n**Example (Double Displacement)**: $Na_{2}SO_{4}(aq) + BaCl_{2}(aq) \\rightarrow BaSO_{4}(s) + 2NaCl(aq)$"
